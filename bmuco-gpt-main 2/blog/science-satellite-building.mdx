## The CubeSat Revolution

Eshpeter explained how modular CubeSat platforms have democratized space access, enabling universities and startups to deploy scientific instruments and communications technology at a fraction of traditional costs.

### What Makes CubeSats Special

- **Standardized form factor**: 10cm cubes that can be stacked
- **Lower launch costs**: Ride-sharing reduces expenses dramatically
- **Rapid development**: Universities can build missions in 2-3 years
- **Educational value**: Students gain hands-on spacecraft experience
- **Scientific capability**: Despite their size, CubeSats enable real research

## From Concept to Orbit

The talk covered the entire lifecycle of a small satellite mission:

1. **Design phase**: Defining mission objectives and constraints
2. **Component selection**: Choosing sensors, radios, processors, and power systems
3. **Testing**: Vibration, thermal-vacuum, and electromagnetic compatibility tests
4. **Integration**: Assembling the satellite and validating all systems
5. **Launch**: Securing a ride to space and deployment procedures
6. **Operations**: Commanding the satellite and downloading data

This practical overview demystified satellite engineering and showed how space technology has become accessible to a new generation of students and entrepreneurs.

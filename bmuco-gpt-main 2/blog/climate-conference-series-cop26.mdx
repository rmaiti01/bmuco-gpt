BMUCO launched its Climate Conference Series in 2021 as a sustained engagement campaign leading to COP26, the UN's landmark climate summit in Glasgow that would shape emissions trajectories and adaptation finance for the coming decade.

BMUCO's second climate conference brought together international experts to address the escalating climate emergency. The session ran from 10:00–11:30 AM BST under the supervision of Prof. John Barry of the UK Climate Assembly—a citizens' forum demonstrating how informed public deliberation can shape national climate policy.

## Featured Speakers

### Dr. Helen Adams — Human Dimensions of Climate Vulnerability

Dr. Helen Adams, Head of Science Engagement for COP26, discussed the human dimensions of climate vulnerability, particularly in marginalized regions of low-income countries where communities face:

- **Displacement**: Climate-induced migration from uninhabitable regions
- **Resource scarcity**: Water and food insecurity under changing patterns
- **Adaptation challenges**: Limited institutional support for resilience building
- **Policy translation**: Converting scientific projections into actionable frameworks

Her work with the OECD and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change focused on water security under changing precipitation patterns.

### Kevin Trenberth — Climate System Dynamics

Kevin Trenberth, Distinguished Scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and IPCC lead author who shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, provided authoritative analysis of climate system dynamics.

With over 30 years of contributions to global climate assessments, Trenberth explained how warming oceans store the majority of excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases—a key mechanism driving:

- **Intensified hurricanes**: Warmer waters fuel stronger storms
- **Altered monsoons**: Shifting precipitation patterns affect billions
- **Accelerating ice sheet melt**: Greenland and Antarctic mass loss
- **Sea level rise**: Thermal expansion and ice melt compound coastal threats

## Partnership Organizations

The conference was supported by:

- **PowerShift Nepal**: A women-led organization advancing female leadership in climate action
- **Eco-Network**: A youth-led global platform mobilizing environmental protection efforts

## First Conference — 24 March 2021

BMUCO launched the series on 24 March 2021, running 1:00–2:00 PM GMT, again under Prof. John Barry's supervision.

The series was conceived as sustained engagement recognizing that COP26 negotiations would determine emissions trajectories for the coming decade. By hosting multiple conferences throughout 2021, BMUCO aimed to:

- **Elevate climate literacy**: Make complex science accessible
- **Foster cross-sector dialogue**: Connect researchers, policymakers, and activists
- **Build momentum**: Generate public pressure for ambitious national commitments
- **Empower youth voices**: Center the generation inheriting climate consequences

## Why Public Engagement Matters

The existential nature of climate change demands not just governmental action but grassroots understanding and pressure. Public education and community organizing prove as crucial as the summit itself.

BMUCO's conference series demonstrated that student-led organizations can convene meaningful climate discourse, bridging academic research and public understanding during critical policy moments.

## A Legacy of Breakthrough Mathematics

Past laureates have revolutionized entire domains of mathematics with work that influences everything from cryptography to machine learning.

### Fields Transformed by Abel Laureates

- **Number theory**: Proof techniques that enabled modern cryptography
- **Topology**: Understanding the shape of space itself
- **Probability theory**: Foundations of statistical inference and machine learning
- **Algebraic geometry**: Connections between equations and geometric structures

The Abel Symposium brings together leading researchers to explore the frontiers opened by prize-winning discoveries, serving as both celebration and catalyst for the next generation of breakthroughs.

## BMUCO's Remarkable Trajectory

For BMUCO—an organization founded by students less than a decade ago—co-organizing an event connected to one of mathematics' most prestigious honors demonstrates remarkable growth.

### From Student Talks to Global Convening

The journey from hosting informal seminars to co-organizing alongside the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters reflects:

- **Earned credibility**: Recognition from established mathematical institutions
- **Global network**: Connections spanning continents and career stages
- **Sustained impact**: Years of consistent, high-quality programming
- **Institutional maturity**: Capacity to manage major international events

## What the Symposium Represents

The Abel Symposium showcases how fundamental mathematical research connects to real-world applications—from quantum computing to climate modeling to artificial intelligence.

By bringing together prize-winning mathematicians, early-career researchers, and curious students, the symposium creates spaces where transformative ideas emerge.

BMUCO's role as co-host ensures that these conversations remain accessible to diverse audiences, maintaining the organization's founding mission even as it operates at the highest levels of mathematical research.

## Looking Forward

This milestone marks not an endpoint but a new chapter. BMUCO continues expanding its reach while staying true to its core mission: connecting frontier researchers with students worldwide, particularly those in under-resourced regions who lack access to such networks.

The Abel Symposium partnership demonstrates that student-led organizations can achieve institutional recognition without losing their grassroots character.
